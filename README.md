# Library

This project is part of the The Odin Project curriculum.
It consist of using what we learned during the JavaScript module to do a library webapp.
For the design of the project, I was inspired by the design I used for the Admin dashboard.

A [Live Demo](https://sephydev.github.io/library/) is available.

## What was the most easy part ?

The most easy part was displaying the book of the array.

## What was the hardest part ?

The hardest part was collecting the data of the form to add a new book. The reason was I forgot about the existence of "submit" event. I also discovered FormData while searching for a solution.
Another problem I had was to delete a book from the array. This time too, I forgot how splice was working. Once I read the documentation I managed to solve the problem.
